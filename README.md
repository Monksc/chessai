# chessai
This is a chess ai I developed using machine learning and minimax algorithm.

# Usage
To play a game against my ai
```
python3 chessgui.py
```

To test out your ai agent against your self,
then go to chessgui.py and change around the players in the main function.
Then run
```
python3 chessgui.py
```

If you want to have two ai agents play against eachother then 
go to main.py and change around the ai agent in there. Then run
```
python3 main.py
```
